## Spring Hibernate Programming

### What are the three Hibernate core classes
* SessionFactory - an immutable thread-safe class that is configured once with all the ORM information
* Session - a "transactional-scoped cache" that is used to actually work with Hibernate managed objects
* HibernateTransactionManager - an implementation of JDBC PlatformTransactionManager for a SessionFactory
