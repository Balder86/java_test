Debian is building the source using mvn, not Maven building a .deb!
Probably better solution for people who know how to build Debian packages
anyway.

TODO:
* actually copy jar file
* substitute maven number in systemd service file or rename jar file
* are differences between debian, maven and git/svn version a problem?

=> INVESTIGATE
