2015-11: Version 0.1 and documentation with errors in all examples I tried. 
         No real CDI support, only Configuration.inject(myObject) which then can have @ConfiguredProperty annotations.
         CDI probably coming with tamaya-integration which was only found in the examples as version 0.2-SNAPSHOT.
