Trying to use Java EE technologies using a standalone program that
bootstraps all necessary services in its main() method.

The different handlers (Static, HTTP, REST, SOAP) can be combined as well.

Glossary:
* Grizzly   - Java NIO Server for HTTP; has Servlet, JAX-RS and JAX-WS containers
* Jersey    - Java JAX-RS implementation
* Jackson   - JSON libarary
* Weld      - Java CDI implementation
