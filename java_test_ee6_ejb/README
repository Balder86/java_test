== Deploying the ear ==

* asadmin deploy --force java_test_ee6_ejb-ear-1.0-SNAPSHOT.ear

== Starting the app-client ==

* asadmin get-client-stubs --appname java_test_ee6_ejb-ear-1.0-SNAPSHOT stub
* cd stub/
* cd java_test_ee6_ejb-ear-1.0-SNAPSHOTClient/
* appclient -client *Client.jar

Don't run the jar in stub/, use the one that's one directory deeper!
